## Visual Narratives and Hidden Languages: A Machine Learning Approach to Movie Poster Analysis
=========================

### Project Overview

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that should be run in the following order:
  1. `Predicting Genres.ipynb`: This notebook downloads poster images and uses the RESNET50 model to predict genres from the posters.
  2. `NLP Processing.ipynb`: This notebook performs NLP cleaning on the plot descriptions and creates a BERTopic model, which is exported to the next notebook.
  3. `Predicting Plot Topics.ipynb`: This notebook uses the RESNET50 model to predict the topics generated by the BERTopic results.


### Dependencies
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn torch torchvision ipython bertopic umap-learn hdbscan nltk sentence_transformers scipy wordcloud

### Project Flowchart

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
Run the notebooks in the following order:
Predicting Genres.ipynb
